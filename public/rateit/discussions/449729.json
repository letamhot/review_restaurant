    "Html": "Is it possible to set the value of the rateit higher than the number of stars?  I know this sounds weird at first, but imagine you had server-side data that you were displaying via rate-it.  This data  has ratings with values between 1 and 100, but on the client side you only want to show a 5-star representation.  This could be worked around by converting the 100 point scale to a 5 point scale, but I wondered if there was an easier way built into the plugin.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis would also make it possible to toggle between a &quot;star rating&quot; mode where your star-rating is saved on a 100-point scale (3 stars = 60 points) and a backing textbox input field where you could manually enter a number.  From the example, however, it looks like the backing field has to match the exact value of the number of stars, though.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nDaniel<br />\n",
