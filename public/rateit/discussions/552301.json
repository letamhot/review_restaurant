I was planing on using the RateIt &quot;BeforeRated&quot; event and the phonegap command &quot;navigator.notification.confirm&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nUnfortunately, I just can't seem to get these two commands to work together. I am sure I missing something but can't work out what!\r<br />\n<br />\nPollen season is fast approaching so I would really REALLY appreciate any help with this!\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!\r<br />\nEd.<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;js/jquery.rateit.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;         \n&lt;script type =&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n\nfunction onConfirm(buttonIndex) {\n    window.drugs = buttonIndex;\n}\n\n//we bind only to the rateit controls within the products div\n     $('#products .rateit').on('beforerated', function (e) {\n\nif (value &gt; 0) {\nnavigator.notification.confirm('Did you take any hayfever medication today?', onConfirm, 'Medication', ['Yes','No']) \n}\n     \n         var ri = $(this);\n         var value = ri.rateit('value');\n         var productID = ri.data('productid');\n         var latitude = window.latitude;\n         var longitude = window.longitude;\n         var accuracy = window.accuracy;\n         var pos_time = window.pos_time;\n         var device_platform = window.device.platform;\n     var device_uuid = window.device.uuid;        \n     var drugs = window.drugs;         \n         ri.rateit('readonly', true);\n\n$.ajax({\n url: 'http://www.website.com/app_sync/survey.php', //your server side script\n data: { id: productID, value: value, latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude, accuracy: accuracy, pos_time: pos_time, device_platform: device_platform, device_uuid: device_uuid, drugs: drugs}, \n  type: 'POST',\n  success: function (data) {\n      navigator.notification.alert(data, null, 'Thanks!', 'OK')\n  },\n  error: function (jxhr, msg, err) {\n      navigator.notification.alert(msg, null, 'Something\\'s gone wrong!', 'OK')\n  }\n});\n});\n        &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n\n",
