I'm using this plugin in two ways and on the same page.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have a news page the main Story has a very big vertical stars and the the oldest topics have horizontal stars which is the same of what you developed. so how I can display stars vertically but don't forget that I need to use horizontal as well.\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI did all what I know but I didn't get it vertical. :)\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you.<br />\n",
