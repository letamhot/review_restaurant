    "Html": "Hi Nimisha,\r<br />\n<br />\nIt seems like you have some sort of integration problem. Perhaps when adding the jQuery dialog, you also add another version of jQuery (thus overriding all registered plugins).\r<br />\nAnother issue might be that the dialog shows its content in an IFRAME, and the IFRAME did not register the rateit script reference.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is also the reason why I closed the issue, since it is an integration problem, not specific to jQuery RateIt.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you can post a small example of your code in jsfiddle.net, it would help us to understand the root of the problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nGidon<br />\n",
