Thanks for sharing it.\r<br />\n<br />\nI would like to be able to have the colour of the stars change depending on the rating.\r<br />\nE.g. 1-5 Stars = Red, 5-8 Stars = Orange, 8-10 Stars = Green.\r<br />\n<br />\nWould this be achievable?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",

This does the trick. In the samples , the idea behind it is similar to the one showing\r\n the antenna &quot;reception&quot; vertical bars. </div>\r\n",
