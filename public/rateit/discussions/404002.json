In order for RateIt to dynamically rebind it needs to be able to bind to some generic &quot;onpagechanged&quot; event, and that doesn't really exist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another way, and few jQuery plugins implement this, is that RateIt would create a timer, and on every x ms would search for new rateit controls on the page and bind them. But I really don't like this: (1) it causes sometimes undesired black magic (2) what\r\n if each control works like that, it would mean many many timers on a page (3) it is against the jQuery standard.</p>\r\n<p>The correct solution lays with the implementor: you. I suppose DataTables.net triggers an event when a page changes (if not, that would be a bug at their side), you will have to handle that event and rebind RateIt on the new page.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
