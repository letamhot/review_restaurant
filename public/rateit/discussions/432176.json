I'm kind of new to jQuery...\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks <br />\n",

    "Html": "If you want you can bind the rateit control to a hidden input field. This way when your page submits the form the values are sent to the server.  Much like how your old rating control worked. \r<br />\nPlease have a look at <a href=\"http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nSee for example 2a and 2b, instead of using select or range you can put a hidden field. \r<br />\n<br />\nIf you want to send the rating using Ajax have a look at example #11. \r<br />\n<br />\nIf you want more info, please put up a jsfiddle and then I can help you with the code. <br />\n",
