I know I could change my markup out for div's, and I probably will. However I just wanted to suggest that a future release might use a more flexible markup like a span rather than a div. In the long run it would achieve the same effect but would not suffer from this small shortcoming. \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
