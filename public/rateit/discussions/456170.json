Depending on the end user's screen size I use the largest size possible and I'd like to resize certain rateit elements on the page as the window resizes to a lower width.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi Joey,\r<br />\n<br />\nI actually think it might not be much of a problem, even with the current code.\r<br />\n<br />\nI believe these are the step you have to perform:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>OnLoad or OnResize add the correct to each of the rate it element , for example &quot;.small&quot;, for 16px, and &quot;.huge&quot; for 64px. These classes match up with classes in your style sheet that match the right pictures.</li>\n<li>\nOnResize: call $('.rateit').rateit('starwidth', XX), and $('.rateit').rateit('starheight', XX), where XX is the new number of pixels (so 64 not '64px').<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nAnd this should be enough.\r<br />\n<br />\nI did a very basic check on step 2, and saw that it resize correctly, so I see no problem with implementing the solution.\r<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps in the future I will add a demo to the examples page showcasing the resize.\r<br />\n<br />\nGidon<br />\n",
