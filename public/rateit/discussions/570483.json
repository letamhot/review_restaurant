    "Html": "I see the issue. It actually does rate, but only one step.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat happens is that each keyboard action results in a rated event. You catch this event, and set the rateit component to readonly, this prevents further rating.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo what has to happen is some extra work from your site to make this work.\r<br />\nYou might want to catch the &quot;blur&quot; event of the rateit control (instead of the &quot;rated&quot; event), and only then send the rating, and set it to readonly.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope that helps.<br />\n",
