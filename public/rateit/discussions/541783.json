I'd rather not have to go back to 1.6.3.<br />\n<br />\nEDIT:<br />\n<br />\nThe symptom I'm experiencing is that when I add the class &quot;rateit&quot; to a div or span, the stars don't appear. I then try to manually evoke rateit with $(&quot;.rateit&quot;).rateit() and get the error &quot;TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'rateit'&quot;<br />\n",
