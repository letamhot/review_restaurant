    "Description": "This issue seems to affect Chrome only as I could not repro on IE11.\nChrome Version 33.0.1750.117 m\n\nWhen using the zoom feature in Chrome, a portion of the next star becomes visible.  For example, a 5 star configuration zoomed at 110% will show the left portion of a sixth star.\n\nThis can be seen on the [samples page](http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm).",
