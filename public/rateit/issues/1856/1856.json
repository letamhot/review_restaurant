    "Description": "I recently updated from version v1.0.9 to v1.0.21. Now when I click a star it send two events the usual \"rated\" event then followed immediately by a \"reset\" event. So it sets the stars and immediately clears it. I switched back to 1.0.9 and all works as before. Here's what the element looks like.\n\n<span \ndata-rateit-resetable=\"\" \ndata-rateit-value=\"2\" \ndata-rateit-ispreset=\"true\" \ndata-post_id=\"8\" \nclass=\"rateit\">\n</span>\n\nand the handler\n\n\t$('.rateit').on('rated reset', function(e){\n\t\tconsole.log( e );\n\t\t$this = $(this);\n\t\t$.post( $this.data('ajax'), { \n\t\t\taction: \"rate_pro\", \n\t\t\tpost_id: $this.data('post_id'), \n\t\t\trating: $this.rateit('value'), \n\t\t\t_wpnonce: $this.data('nonce')\n\t\t\t}, \n\t\t\tfunction(data){}, \n\t\t\t'text');\n\t});\n\nI've tried removeing the reset from the \"on\" above but it still clears the stars.",
