    "Description": "Since updating from Firefox 20 to 21 the input-type \"range\" used as backing field will be displayed. The CSS-Statement \"display:none\" is being ignored. Chrome + Opera are working fine. \n\nYou can see an example for this issue at the [Example-Site of the RateIt-Project](http://www.radioactivethinking.com/rateit/example/example.htm). See examples 2a and 4; see also the attached screenshot.",
