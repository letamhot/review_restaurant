    "Description": "Hi,\n\nLove the plug-in, top work!\n\nI've been playing with it (for a feature on my website, https://toepoke.co.uk and came across an issue.  It _may well_ be something I'm doing wrong but can't figure out what it is.  Anyway I have a workaround which I've added below.\n\nI've attached a zip file which reproduces the problem.\n\nIn essence I'm:\n - Using a separate sprite file (rateit-stars.png) holding both the stars and the reset images.\n - I'm using big stars (32px)\n - I'm using the progressive version against a SELECT dropdown\n\nIf you open the \"_ratings.html\" file (I'm using Chrome) you'll find the first star is yellow (hover image) and the remaining two are red (presets)\n\nNaturally on load these should all be red (presets).  I've worked around the issue by hiding the the \".rateit-hover\" class after initializing your plug-in.\n\nThe workaround is near the bottom of the \"_ratings.html\" file:\n\".find(\".rateit-hover\").hide()\"\n\nI believe the issue is in the template being used, so changing:\n\n\"<{{element}} class=\"rateit-hover\" style=\"height:'\"\nto\n\"<{{element}} class=\"rateit-hover\" style=\"__display: none;__ height:'\"\n\nshould resolve the issue (assuming it is an issue, and not something I'm missing).\n\nMany thanks,\nFranz.",
