    "Description": "It would be nice if there was a way to completely and programmatically reset a RateIt instance back to its initial state. I currently have 'resetable' set to false, but it looks like the code that's fired when the reset button is clicked wouldn't even do what I want. I need things like 'readonly' and 'ispreset' set back to their default values. \n\nMy suggestion would be to do the event handling like jQuery itself. For example, provide a .reset() method that binds the event if you pass in a callback, or triggers the event if you call it with no parameters.\n\nRight now, the easiest way to completely reset RateIt is to remove the element from the DOM, create a new element on the fly, and then initialize a new RateIt instance on that newly-created element. While this isn't absolutely _terrible_, it seems like there should be an easier way to do it.\n\n```\nvar $exampleRateIt = $(\"#exampleRateIt\");\n\nif ($exampleRateIt.length) {\n    $exampleRateIt.remove();\n    $exampleRateIt = $(\"<div id='exampleRateIt'></div>\");\n    $(\"#exampleSibling\").after($exampleRateIt);\n}\n\n$exampleRateIt.rateit({\n    resetable: false,\n    step: 1,\n    min: 0,\n    max: 5\n});\n```",
