      "Message": "Out of my head I would say that one could add a \"svg\" image as background. This would allow you to add textual elements as background.\r\n\r\nAny background, both the GIF and the SVG file could be embedded inside the CSS file (data URI), thus removing the extra image file.I will soon add an example showing this in the examples gallery.\r\n\r\nI guess your real request is to pass in a character on-the-fly. Changing the current layout system would mean a big overhaul. For a later release I might be able to create something that takes that character and builds either a canvas, or svg picture on the fly.",
