      "Message": "You are right, but it might be that people reference those images from another place, and the upgrade will delete those images.\r\n\r\nI cannot say if people did it, I can only say that it might happen. \r\n\r\nSo like you say, we can hold this off for v2.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway for mentioning it, I appreciate it.",
