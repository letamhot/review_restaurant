      "Message": "I see your mistake. \n\nThe backingfld property in the options object should  be a string (the selector to find the backingfield), and not the element itself.\n\nThe stringify function just is the first place that throws an exception because of this mistake, it is ok by itself (because it stringifies the data object of the element, and no actual element).\n\n\r\n\r** Closed by gidon 04/28/2014 11:25PM",

      "Message": "Well it is hardly a mistake, since it's not really documented what type backingfld should be :)\r\n\r\nParsing the selector of the backingfield, here \"#ev\"+cnt, was the first I did, and since it has not been added to the document yet it fails - so it makes sense to parse the object I just created - and it also works fine, except in Chrome etc.\r\n\r\nIf I want a function that returns a form element with a rateit element I can place somewhere, it is detached until returning. It is very common to create controls, elements etc. and then adding them after - and that doesn't work right now. \r\n\r\nGreat plugin by the way! :)",
