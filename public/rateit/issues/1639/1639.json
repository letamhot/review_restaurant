    "Description": "I recently implemented RateIt in a project I'm devloping. I really like it so far but I do have one issue. We have some ratings where the high scores are 3 and 4 respectively. Out default in the database for not-yet-rated was 6. I have the max set up to 3 and 4 with rate it but in FF (and IE 7 - noo too concerned about this one) it will still show 6 stars even though the max is 3 and 4. When you click to rate it will max and 3 and 4, but still displays 6 and 6 even though the max is 3 and 4",
